python-mass-email
=================

My mass email that I use for classes.
It's really not that exciting.
I wrote it because I didn't want to spend an hour sending one email after another to students giving them their username and inital password, and much rather wanted to spend 1.5 to 2 hours learning more python so I could be lazy.
